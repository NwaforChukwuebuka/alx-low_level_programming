Project Name: Makefiles
Description
This project focuses on creating Makefiles for compiling C programs. It includes tasks that require setting up different Makefiles with specific rules and variables to achieve the desired compilation results.

Tasks Overview
Task 0 - Create your first Makefile
Objective: Build an executable named school using a simple Makefile.
Requirements:
The executable should be named school.
Rule all should build the executable without any variables.
Task 1 - Create a Makefile with variables
Objective: Build an executable named school using a Makefile with specified compiler and source files.
Requirements:
The executable should be named school.
Rule all should build the executable using variables CC (compiler) and SRC (.c files).
Task 2 - Create a useful Makefile
Objective: Develop a Makefile that compiles source files into object files and then links them to build the executable.
Requirements:
The executable should be named school.
Rule all should recompile only updated source files.
Variables CC (compiler), SRC (.c files), OBJ (.o files), and NAME (executable name) should be used.
